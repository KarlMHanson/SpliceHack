                   SpliceHack -- General information

SpliceHack is an in-progress fork of NetHack 3.6.1, made with the goal of adding
additional monsters, items, special levels, and game features without changing
too much of the core gameplay. The end goal is a "kitchen sink" variant similar
to SLASH'EM that is still intuitive and easy to pick up and play for anyone
familiar with vanilla NetHack. A secondary goal is to add features that are in
keeping with the "tone" of NetHack, and avoid additions that feel too out of
place.

Suggestions and criticism of the game are welcome. This variant is very much a
work in progress, and as such bugs and balance issues may exist. A wiki can
be found on the github page and there are encyclopedia entries for some new
additions, but as of this moment neither is complete.

Installation is the same as installation for vanilla 3.6.1. Please note that
SpliceHack currently compiles to a binary with the same name as NetHack, so take
care when compiling on a system where NetHack is installed.

SpliceHack follows the conditions put forth in the license provided by the
NetHack Dev Team (see dat/license). If you are aware of any licensing issues
with SpliceHack, please contact us through github.

                  -- Good luck, and happy Hacking --

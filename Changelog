                   GlazeHack -- Changelog

This changelog documents all the features that differ from vanilla Nethack.
Beware of SPOILERS for both Nethack and GlazeHack all the way through this
document.

Toggleable Options
- Intrinsicswap: Gaining a resistance other than poison resistance through food
  will cause you to lose your other resistances. False by default.
- Deaf: A roleplay option and conduct that allows you to play a deaf character.
- Hallucinating: A roleplay option and conduct that allows you to play a
  permanently hallucinating character. Using an artifact to gain hallucination
  resistance will break this, as will drinking a potion of sickness.
- Clumsy: A roleplay option and conduct that allows you to play a permanently
  fumbling character. Probably not terribly hard to ascend with, just very
  frustrating.

General Changes
- Deadly poison is no longer an instant kill, and instead does 1-13 extra
  damage. This change does not affect monsters.
- Monsters are now capable of sacrificing corpses on altars, and all monsters
  that like objects will now pick up corpses (as opposed to just nymphs).
  In rare cases, this can result in monsters being gifted artifacts.
- If a monster on the Astral Plane somehow obtains the Amulet of Yendor and
  makes it to an altar, they will attempt to sacrifice it and gain immortality,
  causing an instant loss.
- Increased number of player monsters in the endgame.
- Player monsters no longer spawn with offensive items, making them much more
  likely to employ their artifacts. Player monsters also have a larger variety
  of artifacts that they can spawn with. Their abilities have been diversified
  somewhat, but all of them are now capable of stealing the amulet with their
  attacks.
- Upon stealing the amulet, if in the endgame a monster will try to flee.
- Decreased floating eye spawn rate to make blind telepathy harder to obtain.
- Mysterious force now only affects you when you are hallucinating (you
  suddenly hallucinate that you are playing vanilla Nethack!)
- There are different descriptions for venom which are randomized each game.
  This may break realism slightly, but does help with distinguishing what kind
  of venom an unfamiliar monster might be spitting.
- Tigers now are colored orange, in order to make room for lions, which are
  colored yellow.
- Disarmed bear traps and land mines can rarely be generated.
- The Oracle now drops hints in major consultations about the new features
  in GlazeHack. Attempts have been made to make this fit as seamlessly as
  possible into the existing tone.
- Additional graves, hallucinations, rumors, scroll and wand names,  and
  the like.
- Spellcasting monsters have access to a much larger variety of dangerous
  spells.
- Engraving "The Yellow Sign" will cause bad things to happen to you and those
  around you.
- Monster wielding behavior was changed so monsters are more aggressive about
  wielding new items.
- VENOM_CLASS and Q_CLASS are referred to differently in game.
- Guards, Nymphs, and Kops are generated with names.
- Nephi's grudge patch has been implemented and expanded, so monsters will
  attack certain other monsters they are opposed to. This dovetails nicely with
  altar changes.
- Dragons have been made subtly more difficult. Hostile monsters with the "roar"
  sound will occasionally roar when the player is nearby, aggravating monsters
  on the level. Additionally, dragons are counted as having hands for the
  purposes of using defensive and utility items.
- Monsters now use a much wider array of items. This includes wands of wishing.
- Transforming into a lycanthrope now angers guards.
- Runeswords and tsurugis can be randomly generated, but they are incredibly
  rare.
- Just like SLASH'EM, baby dragons can be generated.
- Vampire mages un-deferred.
- If preferred pet is set to '@', the player spawns with an adventuring party.
  This is very experimental, and probably should not be used.
- Some of the less powerful or less unique quest nemeses have been changed to
  be more challenging or interesting (see below).
- Bribing demon lords has been greatly expanded. They now can potentially ask
  for powerful items in your inventory instead of gold, and you can also use
  decks of cards to gamble on your immortal soul with them. Challenging them
  with a deck of fate is a Bad Idea.
- All demon lords have had their AC significantly lowered.
- The wailing of the banshee message was changed slightly to account for the
  addition of wailing banshees.
- The addition of so many artifacts changes things. On one hand, the player is
  more likely to find artifacts throughout the dungeon, due to many new artifact
  types. On the other hand, adding artifacts made the Astral Plane slightly more
  difficult, since player monsters now have a greater number of artifacts to
  be generated with.
- Summon nasties has been expanded to accommodate new monsters.
- New demon lords!
- High level adventurers will arise as spectres in their bones files, a more
  powerful type of ghost which is capable of using weapons. Inspired by an
  archived YANI by AmyBSOD and aosdict.
- Additional achievements are tracked in the xlogfile that pertain to this
  variant.

Quest Nemesis Changes
- Lord Surtur can create level-shaking earthquakes when he attacks.
- Nalzok now has a much higher chance of summoning other demons on hit than
  demons found in gehennom.
- Ixoth's claw attack can stun the opponent.
- The Dark One now casts spells twice per turn.
- Thoth Amon now casts a mix of clerical and mage spells. The changes to monster
  sacrifice at altars could also cause some interesting effects.
- Ixoth and the Chromatic Dragon are both affected by dragon changes, and as
  such are potentially nastier.

New Races
- Merfolk: Start with swimming, and eventually learn to breath water. This is
  made up for by low maxed stats.
- Werewolf: Similar to humans, but with permanent, incurable lycanthropy.
  Can be considered a "challenge race."

New Roles
- Cartomancer: A spellcaster with a focus on spell cards (scrolls). They start
  with a number of scrolls, and whenever they use one it has a chance of not
  being consumed. Unfortunately, their skill selection is awful, and they
  receive a harsh alignment penalty for using magic markers (you feel guilty
  for forging a card). The entire role affectionately parodies various trading
  card games and the shows that center on them.
- Dragonmaster: This role is similar to that of a knight, but they begin with
  a pet baby dragon instead of a pony, which they can eventually raise into a
  powerful steed. Due to being raised by dragons, they are averse to wearing
  dragon scales and dragon scale mail, which makes their midgame very difficult.
  Their quest artifact is Sharur, a talking ornate mace.

  contains a wand of wonder.
- The Void: A dangerous one level branch with a very large amount of loot, but
  filled with a number of extremely annoying void-themed monsters and a single
  void dragon.
- Beast den: A special room which contains a number of wild animals.
- Archery Shops: Sell arrows and bows.
- Junk Shops: Function as a general store, but a large selection of what they
  sell is useless.

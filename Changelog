                   GlazeHack -- Changelog

This changelog documents all the features that differ from vanilla nethack.
Beware of SPOILERS for both Nethack and GlazeHack all the way through this
document, particularly in the monsters and items section.

General Changes
- Gaining a resistance other than poison resistance through food will cause you
  to lose your other resistances. This feature can be toggled off in your
  preferences file.
- Decreased floating eye spawn rate to make blind telepathy harder to obtain.
- Mysterious force now only affects you when you are hallucinating (you
  suddenly hallucinate that you are playing vanilla nethack!)
- There are different descriptions for venom which are randomized each game.
  This may break realism slightly, but does help with distinguishing what kind
  of venom an unfamiliar monster might be spitting.
- Tigers now are colored orange, in order to make room for lions, which are
  colored yellow.
- Disarmed bear traps and land mines can rarely be generated.
- The Oracle now drops hints in major consultations about the new features
  in GlazeHack. Attempts have been made to make this fit as seamlessly as
  possible into the existing tone.
- Additional graves, hallucinations, rumors, scroll and wand names,  and
  the like.
- Non-weapon artifacts can now be granted through sacrifice.
- Spellcasting monsters have access to a much larger variety of dangerous
  spells.
- Engraving "The Yellow Sign" will cause bad things to happen to you and those
  around you.
- Monster wielding behavior was changed so monsters are more aggressive about
  wielding new items.
- VENOM_CLASS and Q_CLASS are referred to differently in game.
- Guards, Nymphs, and Kops are generated with names.
- Nephi's grudge patch has been implemented and expanded, so monsters will
  attack certain other monsters they are opposed to.
- Dragons have been made subtly more difficult. Hostile monsters with the "roar"
  sound will occasionally roar when the player is nearby, aggravating monsters
  on the level. Additionally, dragons are counted as having hands for the
  purposes of using defensive and utility items.
- Monsters now use a much wider array of items. This includes wands of wishing.
- Transforming into a lycanthrope now angers guards.
- Runeswords and tsurugis can be randomly generated, but they are incredibly
  rare.
- Just like SLASH'EM, baby dragons can be generated.
- Vampire mages un-deferred.
- If preferred pet is set to '@', the player spawns with an adventuring party.
  This is very experimental, and probably should not be used.

New Races
- Merfolk: Start with swimming, and eventually learn to breath water. This is
  made up for by low maxed stats.
- Werewolf: Similar to humans, but with permanent, incurable lycanthropy.
  Can be considered a "challenge race."

New Roles
- Cartomancer: A spellcaster with a focus on spell cards (scrolls). They start
  with a number of scrolls, and whenever they use one it has a chance of not
  being consumed. Unfortunately, their skill selection is awful, and they
  receive a harsh alignment penalty for using magic markers (you feel guilty
  for forging a card). The entire role affectionately parodies various trading
  card games and the shows that center on them.

New Artifacts
- Gungnir: Odin's spear. Very similar to Mjollnir, but not quite as powerful and
  does not require gauntlets of power to be thrown.
- Gleipnir: The bindings used to contain Fenrir. Base type of grappling hook,
  but with a huge range, increased damage, and the ability to snare enemies
  regardless of size.
- Gae Bulg: Javelin with level-drain abilities. Throwing it at an enemy inflicts
  an instant kill on hit, but Gae Bulg may be lost.
- Gae Dearg: Spear with a chance of cancelling those it strikes.
- Gae Buidhe: Spear with level-drain abilities.
- Carnwennan: The dagger of King Arthur. Grants stealth and searching.
- Black Arrow: An artifact arrow with a large damage and to-hit bonus.
- Seafoam: A trident that grants the ability to breathe water.
- Sharur: A talking warhmamer from Sumerian mythology with a large number of
  abilities. Overpowered to the point that it will likely become a quest
  artifact in the future. Invoking it turns it into a flying lion.
- Vladsbane: A joke artifact which cannot be randomly generated. It's a food
  ration that warns you of undead. Really.
- The King in Yellow: A spellbook of finger of death that grants several
  powerful intrinsics upon reading. Reading or invoking it summons the optional
  superboss of the same name, and very likely ends your game in a matter of
  turns. If you find it, it also grants hallucination resistance while held, so
  it's not 100% useless.
- The Holographic Void Lily: The cartomancer quest artifact. Greatly increases
  spellcasting abilities.

Dungeon Generation
- Statuary level: A level with many statues and statue traps. One statue
  contains a wand of wonder.
- The Void: A dangerous one level branch with a very large amount of loot, but
  filled with a number of extremely annoying void-themed monsters and a single
  void dragon.
- Beast den: A special room which contains a number of wild animals.
- Archery Shops: Sell arrows and bows.
- Junk Shops: Function as a general store, but a large selection of what they
  sell is useless.
- Underground Rivers: Paxed's underground rivers patch has been implemented.

New Monster Spells
- Sonic Scream: Deals massive damage to a single non-deaf target.
- Gas Cloud: Generates a small stinking cloud around the target.
- Slime Spray: Makes the target slippery, possibly causing them to drop their
  wielded items.

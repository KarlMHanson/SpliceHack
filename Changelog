                        SpliceHack -- Changelog

A full list of differences in SpliceHack from vanilla NetHack can be found on
the wiki. This file documents the changes in each version of SpliceHack.

                            Version 4.0

Patches
- Implemented an altered version of the colored walls and floors patch by L.
  Only walls are colored, and the Valley of the Dead is not in grayscale.
- Implemented a heavily modified version of the descriptive hit messages patch
  by L, and combined it with SpliceHack's existing monk hit messages.
- Changes from NetHack 3.6.2B were pulled into the game.

QOL and Major Balance Changes
- Dropped the quest entry requirement to level 10.
- Ported paranoid trap and swim confirmation from xnethack.
- Ported peaceful monster displacement from xnethack.
- Ported NAO 3.4.3's hilite_hidden_stairs option to 3.6.x and SpliceHack.
  Defaults to true.
- Nerfed Lord of the Foocubi and Will-o'-the-wisps after player feedback.
- Only dragons can randomly roar now, as opposed to any monster with MS_ROAR.
- Reduced the number of marids and giant eels on the plane of water.
- Artifact wishing is based on the number of artifacts wished for, not
  generated, preventing the increased  number of artifacts from nerfing artifact
  wishing.
- Monsters can only get wishes from smoky potions now, not wands of
  wishing. Wishes for wands of death and archon figurines were removed.
- Vlad now  has a slowing attack.

New Monsters (8)
- Ported Gnolls, Gnoll Shamans, and Gnoll Chieftains from SLASH'EM.
- Added Lampades, high-level nymphs appearing in Gehennom.
- Added Pack Lords, which transform into Alpha Werewolves. Alpha Werewolves
  transmit regular lycanthropy, and can (rarely) summon normal werewolves.
- Added ratmen and mutated ratmen. Both are low-level monsters that spawn
  randomly.

New Objects
- Ring of Blood Magic: If you do not have enough energy to cast a spell, you
  cast it anyway, but lose hit points equal to the excess energy. Casting
  healing spells using blood magic will deal extra damage to you in order to
  prevent skill farming.
- Ring of Psychic Resistance: One of the few ways in the game to become
  resistant to psionic attacks.
- Ring of Memory: Blocks the forgetting of items, spells, and objects.
  Essentially amnesia resistance.
- Scrolls of Knowledge: Essentially scrolls of reverse identify, like those
  that appear in Nethack, the Next Generation. Reading one will allow you to
  identify any item in the game by prompt.

New Features
- Pets can gain intrinsics through corpses in the same way that the player can.
- Water walking has been implemented for monsters, and functions exactly how one
  would expect.
- Displacement has been implemented for monsters. A displaced monster has a 1/4
  chance of being someplace else when it is melee-d, and then surprising you.
  Displacement can be bypassed using see invisible or telepathy. This feature is
  subject to change on player feedback.
- Monsters can jump. This essentially allows them to do a short range teleport
  to the player if there is an available jumping path.
- All monsters can now gain displacement, water walking, and jumping from
  appropriate items.

Role and Race Changes
- Improved Cartomancer energy levels, which were very low due to a missing case
  in a switch statement.
- Cartomancer basement is now a mines level.
- Easter egg for Cartomancers that read credit cards.
- Chromatic dragons are treated as domestic for Dragonmasters, meaning (among
  other things) that they can be tamed.
- Dragonmasters slowly regenerate energy when standing next to pet dragons.
  Additionally, pet dragons will attempt to help a dragonmaster who is slimed,
  asleep, or stuck.

Miscelaneous Changes and Bug Fixes
- Landsharks are no longer slithy.
- Martial artists and martial masters use monk hit messages.
- Landsharks and Jumping Spiders are capable of jumping. Polymorphing into
  either of these monsters will grant the ability to jump.
- Completely reworked Mephisto's lair.
- The Grim Reaper is now drain resistant.
- Earmuffs are now referred to as "a pair of earmuffs" instead of "earmuff,"
  fixing one of the longest running bugs in SpliceHack.
- Game pluralizes "worm that walks" as "worms that walk," as opposed to the
  Gollum-esque "worms that walkses."
- Psychic and sonic resistance now appear in the enlightenment menu.
- Permanent versus temporary hallucination is now displayed correctly based on
  roleplay options.
- Added a few random god names.

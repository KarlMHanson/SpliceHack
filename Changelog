                   SpliceHack v0.2 -- Changelog

This changelog documents all the features that differ from vanilla Nethack.
Beware of SPOILERS for both Nethack and SpliceHack all the way through this
document.

New Options
- Intrinsicswap: Gaining a resistance other than poison resistance through food
  will cause you to lose your other resistances. Experimental balancing option,
  must be manually enabled.
- Deaf: A roleplay option and conduct that allows you to play a deaf character.
- Hallucinating: A roleplay option and conduct that allows you to play a
  permanently hallucinating character. Using an artifact to gain hallucination
  resistance will break this, as will drinking a potion of sickness.
- Clumsy: A roleplay option and conduct that allows you to play a permanently
  fumbling character. Probably not terribly hard to ascend with, just very
  frustrating.
- Ill-fated: A challenge mode where the dungeon difficulty is automatically
  upped by 50.
- Tips: Gives you a spoiler tip every time you are welcomed. Defaults to true.
- Pet names for birds and dragons can be specified with birdname and dragonname
  respectively. Birds can be set as the preferred pet with "b".

New Commands
- #give can be used to give items to your pet or peaceful monsters, putting the
  items directly in their inventory. This should streamline the process of
  trying to get pets to take something.

Visual/Interface Changes
- Looking at monsters now tells you what weapon they are wielding, and whether
  they are armored. To avoid nerfing wands of probing, the type of armor is not
  indicated.
- Tigers now are colored orange, in order to make room for lions, which are
  colored yellow.
- Branch staircases are colored yellow (ported from xnethack)
- Altars are colored based on alignment (ported from xnethack)
- The Curses patch by Tangles has been implemented, so you can now play in
  curses mode.

General Changes
- SpliceHack Tip of the Day will tell you about new features.
- Deadly poison no longer instantly kills you, but instead will cause both
  HP and attribute damage.
- Probing certain non-unique monsters will tell you their name.
- Monsters are now capable of sacrificing corpses on altars, and all monsters
  that like objects will now pick up corpses (as opposed to just nymphs).
  In rare cases, this can result in monsters being gifted artifacts.
- If a monster on the Astral Plane somehow obtains the Amulet of Yendor and
  makes it to an altar, they will attempt to sacrifice it and gain immortality,
  causing an instant loss.
- Many new artifacts have been added, spanning many different item classes. As
  such, randomly generated artifacts may be slightly more common.
- Increased number of player monsters in the endgame.
- Player monsters no longer spawn with offensive items, making them much more
  likely to employ their artifacts. Player monsters also have a larger variety
  of artifacts that they can spawn with. Their abilities have been diversified
  somewhat, but all of them are now capable of stealing the amulet with their
  attacks.
- Upon stealing the amulet, if in the endgame a monster will try to flee.
- Decreased floating eye spawn rate to make blind telepathy harder to obtain.
- Mysterious force is completely removed. Instead, the amulet blocks all forms
  of teleportation.
- There are different descriptions for venom which are randomized each game.
  This may break realism slightly, but does help with distinguishing what kind
  of venom an unfamiliar monster might be spitting.
- Horned devils are now yellow to make room for dust devils, which are
  brown.
- Barbed devils now have a passive physical damage attack involving their
  barbs.
- Disarmed bear traps and land mines can rarely be generated.
- The Oracle now drops hints in major consultations about the new features
  in SpliceHack. Attempts have been made to make this fit as seamlessly as
  possible into the existing tone.
- Additional graves, hallucinations, rumors, scroll and wand names,  and
  the like.
- Spellcasting monsters have access to a larger variety of dangerous
  spells.
- Engraving "The Yellow Sign" will cause bad things to happen to you and those
  around you.
- Monster wielding behavior was changed so monsters are more aggressive about
  wielding new items.
- VENOM_CLASS and Q_CLASS are referred to differently in game.
- Nephi's grudge patch has been implemented and expanded, so monsters will
  attack certain other monsters they are opposed to. This dovetails nicely with
  altar changes.
- Dragons have been made subtly more difficult. Hostile monsters with the "roar"
  sound will occasionally roar when the player is nearby, aggravating monsters
  on the level. Additionally, dragons are counted as having hands for the
  purposes of using defensive and utility items.
- Monsters now use a much wider array of items. This includes wands of wishing.
- Transforming into a lycanthrope now angers guards.
- Runeswords and tsurugis can be randomly generated, but they are incredibly
  rare.
- Vampire mages, Shimmering Dragons, and Vorpal Jabberwocks un-deferred.
- Some of the less powerful or less unique quest nemeses have been changed to
  be more challenging or interesting (see below).
- Bribing demon lords has been greatly expanded. They now can potentially ask
  for powerful items in your inventory instead of gold, and you can also use
  decks of cards to gamble on your immortal soul with them. Challenging them
  with a deck of fate is a Bad Idea.
- All demon lords have had their AC significantly lowered.
- The wailing of the banshee message was changed slightly to account for the
  addition of wailing banshees.
- The addition of so many artifacts changes things. On one hand, the player is
  more likely to find artifacts throughout the dungeon, due to many new artifact
  types. On the other hand, adding artifacts made the Astral Plane slightly more
  difficult, since player monsters now have a greater number of artifacts to
  be generated with.
- Summon nasties has been expanded to accommodate new monsters.
- High level adventurers will arise as spectres in their bones files, a more
  powerful type of ghost which is capable of using weapons. Inspired by a YANI
  by AmyBSOD and aosdict that was archived on the wiki's YANI list.
- Added RPresser's epitaph patch, allowing you to write your own epitaph if a
  bones file is generated.
- Additional achievements are tracked in the xlogfile that pertain to this
  variant.
- Tangles' and K2's livelogging, whereis, and hardfought configurations have
  been added.
- Pets can now potentially become stunned or invisible by eating the right
  kind of corpse.
- Birds are now a potential kind of pet. You begin with a little bird, which can
  grow up into a falcon and then into a giant falcon. They are balanced around
  the existing pet options.
- Death is generated with a scythe.
- Monsters with heads now "swallow" you instead of "engulfing" you.
- If you are playing an infernal or polymorphed into a silver-hating creature,
  silver will deal an extra 1-20 damage to you.
- Furnaces will spawn in the dungeon. Useful for getting rid of items you don't
  want lying around, and for dipping lavaproof items in for possible effects.
  Please do not try drinking out of a furnace.
- Upon performing the invocation ritual, all unique demons that have not yet
  been generated will appear and immediately teleport to random levels in the
  game. The dungeon will begin to crumble, causing earthquakes centered on you
  occasionally. As you begin to ascend the dungeon, monster spawn rate will
  speed up.
- While you have the amulet, leprechauns are generated awake.
- Added an easter egg message during ascension.
- Trees generate randomly in the dungeon. They use the same code as fountains
  and other features, so will not block the exit.
- Monsters now are more polite, and introduce themselves before trying to
  seduce you. In the future, would like to expand this to monsters introducing
  themselves in other ways.
- Slight restructuring of Gehennom. In the future, would like to redo Gehennom
  entirely, or possibly look into updating the Heck^2 patch for 3.6.1 (MAJOR
  UNDERTAKING)
- Lifesaved monsters will reassess their equipment, so they will equip an
  amulet if that slot is free now, or equip armor if that was disintegrated.
- Some peaceful dialogue for mplayers.

Quest Nemesis Changes
- Lord Surtur can create level-shaking earthquakes when he attacks.
- Nalzok now has a much higher chance of summoning other demons on hit than
  demons found in gehennom.
- Ixoth's claw attack can stun the opponent.
- The Dark One now casts spells twice per turn.
- Thoth Amon now casts a mix of clerical and mage spells. The changes to monster
  sacrifice at altars could also cause some interesting effects.
- Ixoth and the Chromatic Dragon are both affected by dragon changes, and as
  such are potentially nastier.
- All bosses capable of using items are affected by the item use changes.

New Races
- Merfolk: Start with swimming, and eventually learn to breath water. This is
  made up for by low maxed stats.
- Werewolf: Similar to humans, but with permanent, incurable lycanthropy.
  Can be considered a "challenge race."
- Infernal: Gain regeneration and have a strong set of abilities, but many
  monsters are hostile to them and they are vulnerable to silver.
- Angel: Gain flying and have no opposed races, but aggravate monsters and
  have subpar physical abilities. All demon lords will attack them instead
  of chatting.

New Roles
- Cartomancer: A spellcaster with a focus on spell cards (scrolls). They start
  with a number of scrolls, and whenever they use one it has a chance of not
  being consumed. Unfortunately, their skill selection is awful, and they
  receive a harsh alignment penalty for using magic markers (you feel guilty
  for forging a card). The entire role affectionately parodies various trading
  card games and the shows that center on them.
- Dragonmaster: This role is similar to that of a knight, but they begin with
  a pet baby dragon instead of a pony, which they can eventually raise into a
  powerful steed. Due to being raised by dragons, they are averse to wearing
  dragon scales and dragon scale mail, which makes their midgame very difficult.
  Their quest artifact is Sharur, a talking ornate mace.

New Items

  unless cursed. If cursed, offering with it will bring about the wrath of your
  god.

- Amulet of Nausea: Causes nausea while worn.
- Amulet of Danger: Grants infravision, but increases the difficulty of monsters
  spawned.
- Mask: Wearing a mask polymorphs you permanently until it is removed. Removing
  it for any reason degrades the BCU status. Cursed masks will break and damage
  you. Potentially part of an ascension kit.
- Helm of Opaque Thoughts: Grants psionic resistance.
- Playing Card Deck: The messages this deck yields can potentially correlate to
  your luck.
- Deck of Fate: An extremely risky items that can potentially grant wishes or
  end your run. Appears the same as a playing card deck.

- Wand of Sonics: Causes sonic damage, which is hard to resist, but also
  destroys many types of items.
